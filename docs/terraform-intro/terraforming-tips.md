# Tips for using Terraform:

Before using terraform here are some tips you should be aware of and try implementing straight away to optimise your learning.

1. Terraform documentation: Have a tab open with the terraform docs that you always refer back to. The terraform documentation is quite extensive and will allow you to understand the requirements of different resources. https://registry.terraform.io/

2. Testing and Validation: Test your Terraform code rigorously, using tools like 'terraform plan' and 'terraform validate' to validate your configurations before applying changes. This prevents unintended or destructive modifications.

3. Start small: Have an iterative approach to your terraform code. Start off with something simple that works even if it is a single terraform resource. Then look to improving your code by using variables or modules or other best practice approaches.
