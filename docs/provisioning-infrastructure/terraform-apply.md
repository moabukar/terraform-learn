# Once the plan looks good its time to apply!

- The `terraform apply` command is very straight forward and executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan.

- Thats it literally... it outputs a plan as if you have run `terraform plan` and awaits your approval.

- Little tip... if the repetitive plan seems annoying and inconvenient it then you can simply bypass it using the `--auto-approve` flag. But theres nothing wrong with double checking XD
